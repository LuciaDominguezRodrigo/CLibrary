Prints in standar output the first N lines that are readed from standar input. Extension: -head N (N is the number indicating the number of lines taht are going to be printed. In case that N is not indicated, the program will stablish 10 as default N)
### ✔️Tail
Pints in standar output the last N lines that are readed from standar input.  -tail N (N is the number indicating the number of lines taht are going to be printed. In case that N is not indicated, the program will stablish 10 as default N)
### ✔️Longlines
Finds and prints ins tandar output the longest N lines readed from estandar input in descendent order.  -long N (N is the number indicating the number of lines taht are going to be printed. In case that N is not indicated, the program will stablish 10 as default N)

## 📥 Steps for executing the program
 - Open the project in an IDE (like CLion or Visual Studio Code). Is important to execute this project with Linux, regardless the extension (could be Ubuntu, Debian, KaliLinux, etc.).
 - Open a terminal (indicated in the options that the IDE ofers)
 - Execute compila.sh, writing ./compila.sh after the prompt.
 - After that, for executing fuctions, write after the prompt: ./test.exe -functionExtension N
 - For executing fuctions with files, write after the prompt: ./test.exe -functionExtension N < .fileRoute/filename.ext
